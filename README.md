# Joshua Ward's Resume

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f1ebad5e-8369-47a1-a86c-5e195cdef988/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/j2udevelopment/deploys)

This is my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site resume. It is currently
deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at
[j2udevelopment.com](https://www.j2udevelopment.com).

It is also deployed to my [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) at
[j2udevelopment.github.io/resume](https://j2udevelopment.github.io/resume/)
using a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

This resume can also be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster for... reasons (mostly
just using this as an example for how to deploy a static site to a K8s cluster).

```bash
skaffold run
```
